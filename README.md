# Go solutions to LeetCode problems

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a portfolio of my work and to provide a resource for others seeking clear and easy-to-understand solutions to these problems. Every day starting January 5, 2023, I will be adding my solutions to this repository.

> <p style = "color:red"><strong>Please note that:</strong> my solutions are not necessarily optimized for efficiency in terms of time complexity or memory consumption. Instead, my focus is on providing solutions that are clear, follow best practices, and are easy for others to understand and learn from.</p>

If you are seeking more clever or efficient solutions, I recommend checking out these repositories from <a href="https://github.com/halfrost/LeetCode-Go" target="_blank">halfrost</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aQuaYi/LeetCode-in-Go" target="_blank">aQuaYi</a>. They contain solutions that are highly optimized in terms of time and memory complexity.

I understand how challenging it can be to work through these problems and I hope that my solutions can provide guidance and direction for those struggling to find their own solutions.
